== Account and callsigns

=== I have a new callsign, how do I change it?

. Go to the *More -> My account* view, and tap *Change* to change the main callsign attached to your account.
. Go to the *Beacon* view, scroll to the bottom, and tap *Rename*.
. If you have multiple station profiles, switch to each profile by tapping the callsign in the *Beacon view* and rename each profile as needed.
